## Pitch V1

Did you ever consider receiving a reward for doing a good deed? 
As in receiving something for donating to a charity instituition, for example. 
The duto project is just about creating the environment to encourage people to help social causes, 
by rewarding then for each deed with a token. With this token, people can go and exchange it for services and more.
So? Are you interested in knowing more?
