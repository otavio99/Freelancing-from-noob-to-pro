# Dummy Utility Token (DUTO) Manager(????)

O projeto duto visa desenvolver um sistema de recompensas com o objetivo de incentivar as pessoas a ajudarem fundações beneficentes por meio de doação e voluntariado.

### Context

Este projeto é o esforço inicial de criar um sistema que irá gerenciar tokens utilitários que devem funcionar mais ou menos como cartões-presente (ou algo do tipo), mas será algo bastante simples (dummy) para começar.

O objetivo é viabilizar um sistema de token/recompensa para pessoas que doam para entidades beneficentes, recompensando-as com tokens que podem ser trocados em um mercado de serviços digital, que será criado e desenvolvido especialmente para impulsionar o uso dos tokens.

So this project will start with a MVP that employ some of the basic principles of block-chains (the most useful and easy ones) in order to create a token system that will actually be more like gift cards. The initial idea was to actually use utility tokens, but due the complexity of creating it and making use of it, this idea will be postponed for now.

The Token Economy Theory is the base for this project. This theory help parents to create a system of giving tokens or rewards to their children when they perform a desired behavior (a good behavior). To know more about this theory check [this link](https://fcpg.ca/what-is-a-token-system-and-how-can-it-be-helpful-for-my-child-with-autism/#:~:text=A%20token%20system%20or%20token,Ayllon%20%26%20Azrin%2C%201968).

For the case of this project, it is about creating a Token Economy in a community-wide level, to reinforce the behavior of donating to charity institutions. People usually find it hard to donate, mainly when there is no substantial return from doing so.

Then, inside this token community economy, when someone donates to a charity institution, they will receive a token which they can use to acquire a service from a freelancer that is relevant to them. The freelancer will be interested in engaging in this exchange to receive tokens (which they can make use of too) and to promote their work and thus market themselves (these freelancer will be generally people who just started and/or are on the lookout for small work in order to create portfolio and promote themselves).

### Development
As of now, the main work being done is the definition of [OKRs](https://github.com/otavio99/onss-duto/blob/main/okrs.md) and [Generic Scenarios of use](https://github.com/otavio99/onss-duto/blob/main/okrs.md) in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/#what-is-cucumber). As for the development of the system, a code base is being created in the [OFF](https://github.com/otavio99/off) project.
