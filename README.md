# Dummy Utility Token (DUTO) Manager(????)

The duto project aims to develope a reward system with the goal of encouraging people to help charity foundations.

### Context

This project is the initial effort of creating a system that will manage utility tokens that should work more or less like gift cards (or something of the kind), but it will be something quite dummy to begin with.

The goal is to enable a token/reward system for people who donate to charity entites, by rewarding them with tokens that can be exchanged in a digital service market that will be created and developed specially to boost the use of the tokens.

So this project will start with a MVP that employ some of the basic principles of blockchains (the most usefull and easy ones) in order to create a token system that will actually be more like vouchers or gift cards. The initial idea was to actually use utility tokens, but due the complexity of creating it and making use of it, this idea will be postponed for now.

The Token Economy Theory is the base for this project. This theory help parents to create a system of givin tokens or rewards to their children when they perform a desired behaviour (a good behaviour). To know more about this theory check [this link](https://fcpg.ca/what-is-a-token-system-and-how-can-it-be-helpful-for-my-child-with-autism/#:~:text=A%20token%20system%20or%20token,Ayllon%20%26%20Azrin%2C%201968). 

For the case of this project, it is about creating a Token Economy in a comunity-wide level, to reinforce the behaviour of donating to charity institutions. People usually find it hard to donate, mainly when there is no substantial return from doing so. 

Then, inside this token comunity economy, when someone donates to a charity institution, they will receive a token which they can use to acquire a service from a freelancer that is relevant to them. The freelancer will be interested in engaging in this exchange to receive tokens (which they can make use of too) and to promote their work and thus market themselves (these freelancer will be generally people who just started and/or are on the lookout for small work in order to create portifolio and promote themselves).

### Development
As of now, the main work being done is the definition of [OKRs](https://github.com/otavio99/onss-duto/blob/main/okrs.md) and [Generic Scenarios of use](https://github.com/otavio99/onss-duto/blob/main/okrs.md) in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/#what-is-cucumber). As for the development of the system, a code base is being created in the [OFF](https://github.com/otavio99/off) project.
