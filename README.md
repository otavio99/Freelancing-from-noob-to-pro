# Dummy Utility Token

This project is the initial effort of creating a system that will manage utility tokens that should work more or less like vouchers.

The goal of this project is to enable a token/reward system for people who donate to charity entites, by rewarding them with tokens that can be exchanged in a digital service market that will be created specially to boost the use of the tokens.

### Simple Use Case
For this use case, we are going to have 3 parties: customer, freelancer volunteer, charity volunteer/manager. 
**Customer:** A person who wants to donate and utilize rewarded tokens to exchange for utilities or services in the digital market.
**Freelancer volunteer:** A person who is willing to offer a small-time service inside the digital market in exchange of tokens and free marketing of their services
**Charity Volunteer/Manager:** A person who is in charge of helping charities and is looking for more funding to boost the charity cause
