# Freelancer, from Noob to Pro

This repo is a intent of compiling and curating the most useful tips, mindsets and content around freelancing. For now It will be more about how to be a freelance developer, but next it will be covered other types of freelancers.

In the future this will become a blog or a course of some sort to make things more organized, but for now all content will be set here at the README of this repo.

## Programming, the basics

### You don't need to learn everything

A common thing that most people think when they go into programming, is that they will only start working once they have learned everything that there is to know about the subject. But the thing is, programming is more of a skill than anything else, which means that even though the skill is not at a top level yet, one can start making profit with it. 

Just like people who doesnt know how to cook well. If the person practices a few recipes and do some quick courses, it would not be too impossible to find people willing to pay for that food. Of course, the person will not be as good as bobby flay or gordon ramsay (it would take several years and talent to do so), but no one needs to be like those two to start making money with cooking food, and the same applies to programming. 

There is a fair amount of skilled programmers out there (like hackers) and getting at their level would require several years and talent too, but you can start making money if you have honned your programming skill enough (this actually might take just a few months).

So programming is just a skill that anyone can learn. I am sorry to break it to you, but if you spent years trying to be the best programmer out there without trying to land a job or a freelancing, then you have wasted your time.

### Programming Languages, what you need to know
 
If there is one essential thing you need to know about programming languages, is that every single one of then were created for a specific purpose. Understaning it will save you a lot of time, since it will be easier to indetify if its worth to learn a programming language or not. 

And if you for some reason becomes a fan of a specific programming language, you'd be wasting your time. As it was stated, every programming language serves a purpose and you should pick a programming language based on it solely. Do not try to use the programming language outside its purpose and do not become very attachecd to a programming language beacuse you are just making your life harder.

And despite how much different a programming language may look and feel from another, all of them share a common base. So its not crazy to say that once you learn a programming language, learning another one is quite easy. Of course it depends on the use and purpose you have, but it will be fairly more easy.
